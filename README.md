## **The Origin of MountainKid Valley**

I was 17 when I got a severe heart pain and still could recall writing those last words in my journal -- Dear death, if you leave me today, next time when you come, I will make you cry. Thankfully, my mom took me to hospital and the reason turned out to be my bad sleep schedule and skipping food. But this incident made me realize that real life is living a long life in a short time rather than living a short life in a long time.Perhaps this could be the reason behind my risk taking nature in life. Truth be told, my earlier goal was to simply build a Bank - [AlpKid](https://alpkid.com/) and a software company [MountainKid AI](https://www.mountainkid.ai/) that solves problems (Sari,rfSE Club, Phunsuk,Sari farms) with Mathematics, Physics & First Principles. But some events in my life last year made me realize the purpose of my life - Build the next valley that inspires generations to dream, think, learn, challege the status quo to innovate and invent things. And thats how my journey with empty hands to building MountainKid valley evolved.

Though I was born and raised in Andhra Pradesh, there is no doubt in saying that I know more about Himachal than the place where I was born due to my introvert lifestyle all my life and I came here in 2019 and didn't visit home till date since I feel that I belong to mountains. And that’s how MountainKid name evolved (a real Phadi is the one who sees life/God in Nature)

 ## **What actually MountainKid Valley wants to solve?**

The moment you step out of your home, you have entertainment hubs everywhere, but there is no place to learn, think, write, change, dream, innovate , invent, challenge yourself. and thats what MountainKid Valley is all about. its a place where free minded souls gather together to do something meaningful, something that pushes human civilization forward. something, that creates fulfilment in life for thsoe individuals.
